## About me
```cs
Developer Leonardo = new Developer{
  Nickname = "Leo",
  Code = new List<string> {"C#", "Python", "Java", "Javascript", "Typescript"},
  Tools = new List<string> {".NET", "Docker", "Kubernetes", "Node", "Angular"}
  Architecture = new List<string> {"Microservices", "Design system pattern"},
  FunTime = new List<string> {"Play videogames", "Watch movies", "Hangout with friends", "Code benchmarks"}
  State = "Trying my best to learn and become a better developer!"
}
```

<p>I am a Computer Engineer graduated @ Pontif√≠cia Universidade Cat√≥lica do Rio de Janeiro. Skilled in C#, Python, Java and a fast learner interested in any new language. I've always enjoyed studying and that explains many of the personal projects I've developed such as bots, game mods, code benchmarks and other applications for personal use.</p>
